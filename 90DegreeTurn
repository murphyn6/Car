Making the robot turn 90 degrees is a pretty simple thing to do. Basically you have to make one wheel move in an arc while the other wheel stays still. To do this we will use the distance between the wheels as the radius of the circle and use that to find the circumference through C=2pi*r. Then to turn 90 degrees one wheel needs to travel 1/4 the circumference. Using the circumference of the wheel we can determine how far the car travels per rotation, then if we divide that value by 40 we can determine how much the car travels per interrupt value. Then all we have to do is divide C/4 by the distance per interrupt value to determine how many counts one wheel has to travel to turn the car 90 degrees.
